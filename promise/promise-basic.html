        // Promise is an object that produce any value(may be number, object,array) in Future. We can use the promise for handling asyncronous call(not waiting for others).
        
        /*
        We can see the promise in the following states
        1.fullfilled-This state indicates that specified operation was completed-resolve()
        2.rejected-This state indicates that the operation did not complete. In this case an error value will be thrown-reject()
        3.pending-This is an initial state of the Promise before an operation begins

        Note==> There is no any method for the pending method.
