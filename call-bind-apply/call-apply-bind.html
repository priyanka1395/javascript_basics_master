    let emp = {//object literal
        firstName: "Mohan",
        lastName: "Kumar",
        getCompleteName: function () {//method
            console.log("The name is " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName);
        }
    }

    //Question : this operator inside the getCompleteName function refers to whom
    //Ans : this refers to the emp object
    emp.getCompleteName();
    //The name is Mohan kumar
    //Output : The name is Mohan Kumar

    // getCompleteName(); : Here this will search function inside the browser object

    //I have made this common function
    function getCompleteName2() {//function + present inside the browser object
        console.log("The name is " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName);
    }

    /*
1. getCompleteName2() : Preset inside the browser object
2. this refers to whom ?
Ans : this will point towards the browser object
3. Output will be what when we call it.
Ans : The name is undefined undefined
Why ?
The reason is that this refers to browser object. And there it is searching for firstName and lalstName.
But we have not created any global variable with name firstName and lastName
 
Question ?
Suppose getCompleteName2() we want to call for the emp object. we want this operator inside 
function to point towards the emp object 
    */

    //getCompleteName2()
    getCompleteName2.call(emp);
    //getCompleteName2 gets called in context with emp object
    //now this operator inside the getCompleteName2() is pointing towards the emp onject


    //Passing the argument to the call function
    function getCompleteName3(city, state) {//function + present inside the browser object
        console.log("The name is " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", City is " + city, ", State is " + state);
        //firstName , lastName is referring towards the object and city is taken from argumnet passed
    }
    getCompleteName3("Bangalore", "Karnataka");
    //Output : The name is undefined undefined, City is Bangalore
    getCompleteName3.call(emp, "Bangalore", "Karnataka");
    //Output : The name is Mohan Kumar, City is Bangalore

    getCompleteName3.call(emp, ["Bangalore", "Karnataka"]);
    //Output : The name is Mohan Kumar, City is Bangalore,Karnataka , State is undefined

    //Solution 
    //apply method
    //when we are passing argument as an array then use apply method
    getCompleteName3.apply(emp, ["Bangalore", "Karnataka"]);
    //apply method splitting the bangalore and karnataka into city and state argumnet
    //Output : The name is Mohan Kumar, City is Bangalore , State is Karnataka

    //bind : This function is used to bind the function in context with object. And returns the ref

    var funRef = getCompleteName3.bind(emp, "Bangalore", "Karnataka");
    //Here in above program it is unly binding
    //The name is Mohan Kumar, City is Bangalore , State is Karnataka
    funRef();
    funRef()
